### Description ###

<p> This program shows a robot standing on a plane. If you press 'W' he will walk. If you press "R" he will shoot. If you press 'ESC' or 'Q' the program will exit </p>

### Technology ###

This project is based off Ogre3d: <br />

````
OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for developers to produce applications utilising hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes.
````

<p> To run, you are required to install OGRE3d http://www.ogre3d.org/ and include all headers and libraries. You must also include OgreMain.dll OIS.dll and RenderSystem_GL.dll in the top directory of the project. </p>
