This game was originially developed as an open source project. We felt it did a good job of creating a simple user interface for the game of tic-tac-toe but lacked some features in gameplay and logic. We implemented settings so the player can now choose turn order and symbol as well as optimized computer strategy. Computer logic currently has only hard difficulty, but it is reasonable that lesser difficulty levels can be added in the future.

The project utilizes Qt framework, it is recommended you build it using Qt Creator software.
